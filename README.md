# üñ•Ô∏è x86 Assembly Programming Collection

![x86 Assembly](https://img.shields.io/badge/Assembly-x86-red) 

A growing collection of **well-commented** x86 assembly programs for learning low-level programming on 8086/8088 processors. Perfect for hardware enthusiasts.

## üìã Current Programs

### üî¢ Arithmetic Operations
- [16-bit Addition](arithmetic/addition.asm) - Adds two numbers

### üß† Core Concept
```asm
mov ax, [num1]    ; Load first number into AX register
add ax, [num2]    ; Add second number to AX
mov [result], ax   ; Store result in memory
```
- [Multiplication](Multiplication.asm) - Multiply two numbers

### üß† Core Concept
```asm
mov al, NUM1  ; Load first number into AL register
mov bl, NUM2 ; Load second number into BL register
mul bl ; multiplies AL*BL and stores values in another register 
```
- [Division](Division.asm) - Division of two numbers

### üß† Core Concept
```asm
mov AX, num1 ; Load 1st number (quotient)  into AX register
mov DX, 0 ; clear DX
mov BX, num2 ; Load 2nd number (remainder) into BX register
div BX ; AX/BX -> quotient in AX, remainder into DX
```
### üìú Loop Operation
-[loop of numbers](loop.asm) - Loop of numbers from 1 to 10 

### üß† Core Concept

```asm
mov CX, 10
mov AX, 1
print_loop:
   ; Display AX (implementation omitted)
   inc AX
   loop print_loop  ; CX-- then jump if CX‚â†0
```
-[Ascending Order of Numbers](ascOrder.asm) - Arranging numbers in ascending order 

### üß† Core Concept

```asm
MOV CH, 04H
UP2: CL, 04H
LEA SI, STRING1
CMP AL, BL ; After initialising both the registers (source index need to be initiated as well)
JC DOWN ; Move the number down which was comparred 

DOWN: INC SI ; Increment of SI
DEC CL 
JNZ UP1 ; If non zero then jump to UP1 
DEC CH
JNZ UP2 ; If non zero then jump to UP2 
```
### üß† Core Concept
```asm
; Assume input is in an array 'str' of length 'len'

mov ecx, 0              ; index from start
mov edx, len            ; index from end
dec edx                 ; make it zero-based

pal_check:
    cmp ecx, edx
    jge done            ; if indices meet/cross, it's a palindrome
    mov al, [str + ecx]
    mov bl, [str + edx]
    cmp al, bl
    jne not_palindrome
    inc ecx
    dec edx
    jmp pal_check

done:
    ; palindrome confirmed
    ; (add your logic here)
    jmp end

not_palindrome:
    ; not a palindrome
    ; (add your logic here)

end:
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### Requirements
- NASM assembler
- DOSBox or EMU8086 emulator
- (Optional) ALINK linker

### How to Run
1. Assemble the program:
   ```sh
   nasm -f bin program.asm -o program.com
